the confusion
the roaring din
louder every moment -- the shrieks of wounded women
the shrieks of wounded women
wounded women
swords and arms
swords
arms
their mark
a few steps from her
The doors
Zoroaster
The priests
Zoroaster , unconscious of their danger and of all that was going on in the palace , singing the hymns of the sacrifice before the sacred fire
a small voice behind her
the little Syrian slave
Both women
the Syrian girl
the Syrian
the priests and before Zoroaster himself
the rushing of many feet outside , and the yelling of hoarse voices
the yelling of hoarse voices
hoarse voices
the clang of arms
The seventy priests
him
the high priest
their chief
the ocean
Nehushta 's hand
`` Knowest thou not , Zoroaster , that I would rather die with thee than live with any other ?
Her soft voice
her own sentence of death
the voice of the little Syrian maid
the little Syrian maid
they
she
the fiends of hell
Some of them
my mistress
Zoroaster 's hand
the helpless priests
Her one thought
Foremost in the little crowd
the little crowd
a stern , dark man -- the same who had been the high priest before Zoroaster came , the same who had first hurled defiance at the intruder
the same who had been the high priest before Zoroaster came , the same who had first hurled defiance at the intruder
the same who had first hurled defiance at the intruder
the intruder
We
enthusiasm for his chief
you
a radiance of unearthly glory
The foe
The thundering at the doors
Zoroaster 's voice
the band of priests
The little Syrian girl
you
Ahura Mazda
The Lord Ahura Mazda , who made all things
The Lord Ahura Mazda
them and they
the years and the ages ; Praise him who in the heavens hath sown and hath scattered the seed of the stars ; Praise him who moves between the three ages that are , and that have been , and shall be ; Praise him who rides on death , in whose hand are all power and honour and glory ; Praise him who made what seemeth , the image of living , the shadow of life ; Praise him
rides on death
honour and glory
the light , Who made the day of life , that should rise up and lighten the shadow of death
the day of life , that should rise up and lighten the shadow of death
life , that should rise up and lighten the shadow of death
the shadow of death
the great bronze doors
the ears of the priests
the caldron of hell
the lust of blood and their hands
blood and their hands
Their crooked swords
two women
Their rage
some of them
each priest
a heap of slain and laid hold of Nehushta
slain and laid hold of Nehushta
laid hold of Nehushta
Zoroaster 's thin arms
both hands
a sharp blade
the small hands
One shriek -- and that was all ; for the same sword
the same sword
Nehushta 's head
you
The keen sword
Nehushta 's neck
Echatana
Darius the king
the king
a messenger
his soldiers
Stakhar
the arms of his most faithful and beloved servant
his most faithful and beloved servant
two thousand of them
Nehushta the queen

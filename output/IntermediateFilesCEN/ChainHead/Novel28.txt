Marzio
The boy who alone had remained at work
the current of his thoughts
his thoughts
You
me
the details of the design he meditated against his brother 's life
the design he meditated against his brother 's life
his brother 's life
the sound behind him
last repeating his conclusion
that day so often fancied him dead , lying on the floor of the workshop
his eyes
the floor of the workshop
his body
his fingers
spite of all this
one
the waking from a hideous dream of evil to find that the harm is still undone , to experience that sense of unutterable relief which every one knows when the dawn suddenly touches the outlines of familiar objects in the room

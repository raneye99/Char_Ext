Soldier
leave
a bit further
Devil
his majesty
some roast beef
they
his eyes
His stupidity
make you a merchant
King
Princess
The other merchants
what sort of person he is
that very night
the sentry
these words
the courtiers
evening
his eyes
the cocks
last night
The next night
the third night
them
pincers
in the pincers
He beat him
thirty versts from here

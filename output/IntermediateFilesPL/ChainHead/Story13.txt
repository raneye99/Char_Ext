Queen
Prince Danila
Princess Catherine
Witch
his betrothed
another
all the lovely maidens
fate
the wedding
Some old women
four little dolls
earth
the sister's head
everywhere
chicken legs
the old way with your back to the woods and your front to me
Witch's daughter
these words
passers-by
all
anyone
Some little old men
her nose
the other
her legs
A servant
one
the other
a good man
all of them
forever after

In a certain kingdom, in a certain land, there lived a king; in his courtyard
there was a pillar, and on the pillar three rings, one of gold, one of silver,
and one of copper. One night the king dreamed that a horse was tied to the
golden ring; every hair on the horse's body was silver, and on his brow was a
glistening moon. In the morning the king arose and sent forth a call
proclaiming that to anyone who could tell him the meaning of this dream and
get for him that horse, he would give his daughter and half his kingdom as a
dowry.

In answer to the king's summons a multitude of princes, boyars, and lords of
every description gathered together; they thought and thought, but not one of
them could tell the meaning of the dream and not one of them would undertake
to get the horse. At last it was reported to the king that a certain poor old
peasant had a son, named Ivan, who could explain his dream and get the horse
for him. The king sent for Ivan and asked him: "Can you explain my dream and
get that horse?" Ivan answered: "Tell me first what the dream was and what
horse you want." The king said: "Last night I dreamed that to the golden ring
in my courtyard a horse was tied, and every hair on his body was silver, and
on his brow was a glistening moon." "That was not a dream, but a reality,"
said Ivan. "For last night the twelve-headed dragon came to your kingdom on
that horse and wanted to steal your daughter." "And can you get that horse?"
"I can," answered Ivan. "But not before I have passed my fifteenth year."

At that time Ivan was only twelve years old. So the king took him into his
palace and gave him food and drink till he reached his fifteenth year. When
his fifteenth year had passed, he said to the king: "Sire, give me a horse on
which to ride to the land of the dragon." The king led him to his stables and
showed him all his horses. But Ivan could not find one strong enough to carry
his great weight; when he put his mighty hand on a horse, the horse would fall
to the ground. Then Ivan said to the king: "Let me go into the open field and
seek a horse suited to my strength." The king let him go.

Ivan the peasant's son looked for three years and nowhere could he find a
horse. He was returning in tears to the king, when he met an old man who asked
him: "Why are you weeping, young fellow?" Ivan answered this question rudely
and chased the old man away. The old man said: "Mind you, young fellow, do not
speak ill of me!" Ivan walked for a little distance away from the old man and
thought to himself: "Why did I offend him? Old people know a great deal." He
turned back, caught up with the old man, fell at his feet, and said:
"Grandfather, forgive me, I offended you because of my own grief. This is why
I am weeping: for three years I have traveled in the open field through many
droves of horses, and nowhere can I find a horse strong enough for me." The
old man said: "Go to such and such a village. There in the stable of a peasant
is a mare. That mare has given birth to a mangy colt. Take this colt and feed
him. Soon he will be suited to your strength."

Ivan bowed deeply to the old man and went to that village. He went straight to
the peasant's stable, saw the mare with the mangy colt, and put his hands upon
him. The colt did not shy away in the least. Ivan took him from the peasant,
fed him for some time, went back to the king, and said that he had found a
horse for himself. Then he began to make ready to visit the dragon. The king
asked him: "How many men do you need, Ivan?" Ivan answered: "What do I need
men for? I can get the horse by myself; but you might give me half a dozen men
to carry messages back and forth."

The king gave him six men; they made ready and set out. Whether they traveled
a long time or a short time, no one knows. But we do know that they came to a
river of fire; over the river was a bridge and around it an enormous forest.
They pitched a tent in the forest, got out a variety of refreshments, and
began to eat, drink, and make merry.

Ivan the peasant's son said to his companions: "Let us each stand guard every
night in turn, to see whether anyone crosses this river." But all of Ivan's
companions when they kept watch got drunk and did not see anything. Finally,
Ivan the peasant's son himself stood guard, and just at midnight he saw a
three-headed dragon, who crossed the river and said: "I have no enemy and no
slanderer, except perhaps one enemy and one slanderer, Ivan the peasant's son.
But the raven has not even brought his bones here in a bladder!"

Ivan the peasant's son sprang out from under the bridge. "You lie!" he said.
"I am here." "If you are here, let us join in combat." And the dragon rode on
horseback against Ivan, but Ivan advanced on foot, took a swing with his saber,
and cut off all three of the dragon's heads, took his horse, and tied him to
the tent. The next night Ivan the peasant's son slew the six-headed dragon and
on the third night the nine-headed one, and cast them each into the river of
fire. When he went to the bridge on the fourth night, the twelve-headed dragon
came to him and said angrily: "Who is Ivan the peasant's son? Why did he slay
my Sons? Let him come out to meet me forthwith!"

Ivan the peasant's son stepped forward and said: "First let me go to my tent,
then we shall join in combat." "Very well, go." Ivan ran to his companions,
and said: "Here, boys, is a bowl. Look into it; when it is filled with blood,
come to me." He returned and faced the dragon; and when they rode apart and
then clashed, Ivan at the first blow cut off four of the dragon's heads, but
himself sank into the earth up to his knees. They clashed a second time, and
Ivan cut off three dragon heads, and sank into the earth to his waist. They
clashed a third time, and he cut off three more heads, but sank into the earth
up to his breast. Finally he cut off one more head, and sank into the earth up
to his neck. Then only did his companions remember him; they looked into the
bowl and saw that blood was overflowing its brim. They rushed out, cut off the
last head of the dragon, and pulled Ivan out of the earth. Ivan the peasant's
son took the dragon's horse and led him to the tent.

Night passed and morning came; the brave youths began to eat and drink and
make merry. Ivan rose from the merrymaking and said to his companions: "Wait
for me." He changed himself into a cat, crossed the bridge over the river of
fire, came to the house of the dragons, and made friends with the cats there.
In the whole house only the dragon's wife and her three daughters-in-law
remained alive. They sat in the chamber and spoke among themselves: "How can
we destroy that scoundrel, Ivan the peasant's son?"

The youngest daughter-in-law said: "Wherever Ivan the peasant's son goes, I
will bring a famine on the road, and turn myself into an apple tree; when he
eats one of my apples he will burst!"

The second daughter-in-law said: "And I will make a thirst on the road, and
turn myself into a well; let him try to drink!" The eldest said: "And I will
bring a drowsiness upon him, and turn myself into a bed; when Ivan the
peasant's son lies down upon it, he will die at once."

Finally their mother-in-law said: "And I will open my mouth from earth to sky
and devour them all."

Ivan the peasant's son heard everything they said, went out of the chamber,
turned into a man, came back to his companions, and said to them: "Well, boys,
make ready to go."

They made ready, set out, and at once a terrible hunger came to them; but they
had nothing to eat. Suddenly they saw an apple tree; Ivan's companions wanted
to pluck some apples, but Ivan forbade them. "This," he said, "is not an apple
tree." He began to cut it down; and blood spurted out of its trunk. Soon
afterward they were overwhelmed by thirst. Ivan saw a well, forbade his
companions to drink from it, and began to hack its stones; blood flowed from
the well. Then drowsiness came upon them; a bed stood on the road, but Ivan
slashed through it too. At last they came to a mouth opened from earth to sky.
What could they do? They thought of jumping over it on the run, but no one
could jump it, except Ivan the peasant's son. He was rescued from this
predicament by his wonderful horse, every hair of whose body was silver, and
whose brow bore a glistening moon.

He came to a river; near the river stood a little hut. There he met a little
man as big as a thumb, with a mustache seven versts long, who said to him:
"Give me your horse, and if you do not give him to me willingly, I will take
him by force." Ivan answered: "Get out of my path, accursed reptile, or I
shall crush you under my horse!"

The little man as big as a thumb, with a mustache seven versts long, knocked
him to the ground, sat himself on the horse, and rode away. Ivan entered the
hut and grieved greatly for his horse. In the hut a footless and handless man
was lying on the stove. He said to Ivan: "Listen, brave youth - I know not how
to call you by name - why did you try to fight him? I was a greater champion
than you, yet he ate off my hands and my feet." "Why?" "Because I ate bread
from his table." Ivan asked the man how he could recover his horse. The
footless and handless man said to him: "Go to such and such a river, take the
ferryboat, ferry for three years, accept money from no one - then you may get
your horse back."

Ivan bowed deeply to him, went to the river, took the ferry boat, and for
three whole years ferried and took no money for it. Once he ferried three old
men across the river; they offered him money, but he refused it. "Tell me,
brave youth, why don't you take money?" He answered: "Because of a promise I
made." "What promise?" "A perfidious man took my horse, and a good man told me
to row the ferry for three years and accept money from no one." The old men
said: "If you wish, Ivan, peasant's son, we can help you to get back your
horse." "Do help me, my friends!"

These old men were not ordinary people; they were the Freezer, the Glutton,
and the Magician. The Magician stepped on the shore, drew the picture of a
boat on the sand, and said: "Brothers, do you see this boat?" "We see it."
"Sit in it." All four of them sat in the boat. The Magician said: "Now, little
light boat, serve me as you have served me before." Suddenly the boat rose in
the air and in a trice, like an arrow shot from a bow, brought them to a big,
stony mountain. On that mountain stood a house, and in the house lived the
little man as big as a thumb, with a mustache seven versts long. The old men
sent Ivan to ask for the horse. Ivan asked for it; the little man as big as a
thumb, with a mustache seven versts long, said to him: "Steal the king's
daughter and bring her to me; then I will return your horse."

Ivan told this to his companions, and they left him at once and went to the
king. The king learned what they had come for and ordered his servants to heat
a bath red hot - "Let them suffocate there!" He asked his guests to go into
the bath; they thanked him and went. The Magician ordered the Freezer to go
first. The Freezer went into the bath and cooled it; then they washed and
steamed themselves and came before the king. The king ordered a great feast to
be served; a vast array of viands was placed on the table. The Glutton ate
everything.

At night the three guests made secret preparations, stole the princess,
brought her to the little man as big as a thumb, with a mustache seven versts
long, and got the horse in exchange. Ivan the peasant's son bowed deeply to
the old men, bestrode the horse, and started on his journey back to the king.
He rode and rode, stopped in the open field to take a rest, pitched his tent,
and lay down. When he awoke, he discovered the princess lying beside him. He
was overjoyed and asked: "How did you get here?" The princess said: "I changed
into a pin and stuck myself into your collar."

At that moment she again turned into a pin; Ivan the peasant's son stuck her
in his collar and rode on. He came to the king, who, upon seeing the marvelous
horse, received the brave youth with honor and told him that his daughter had
been stolen. Ivan said: "Do not grieve, Sire, I have brought her back." He
went into the next room and the pin in his collar turned into a lovely maiden.
Ivan took her by the hand and led her to the king. The king was even more
overjoyed, took the horse for himself, and gave his daughter to Ivan the
peasant's son in marriage. And even now Ivan is living happily with his young
wife.

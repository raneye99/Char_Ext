In a certain kingdom there lived a merchant. Although he had been married for 
twelve years, he had only one daughter, called Vasilisa the Beautiful. When 
the girl was eight years old, her mother died. On her deathbed the merchant's 
wife called her daughter, took a doll from under her coverlet, gave it to the 
girl, and said: "Listen, Vasilisushka. Remember and heed my last words. I am 
dying, and together with my maternal blessing I leave you this doll. Always 
keep it with you and do not show it to anyone; if you get into trouble, give 
the doll food, and ask its advice. When it has eaten, it will tell you what to 
do in your trouble." Then the mother kissed her child and died.

After his wife's death the merchant mourned as is proper, and then began to 
think of marrying again. He was a handsome man and had no difficulty in 
finding a bride, but he liked best a certain widow. Because she was elderly 
and had two daughters of her own, of almost the same age as Vasilisa, he 
thought that she was an experienced housewife and mother. So he married her, 
but was deceived, for she did not turn out to be a good mother for his 
Vasilisa. Vasilisa was the most beautiful girl in the village; her stepmother 
and stepsisters were jealous of her beauty and tormented her by giving her all 
kinds of work to do, hoping that she would grow thin from toil and tanned from 
exposure to the wind and sun; in truth, she had a most miserable life. But 
Vasilisa bore all this without complaint and became lovelier and more buxom, 
every day, while the stepmother and her daughters grew thin and ugly from 
spite, although they always sat with folded hands, like ladies.

How did all this come about? Vasilisa was helped by her doll. Without its aid 
the girl could never have managed all that work. In return, Vasilisa sometimes 
did not eat, but kept the choicest morsels for her doll. And at night, when 
everyone was asleep, she would lock herself in the little room in which she 
lived, and would give the doll a treat, saying: "Now, little doll, eat, and 
listen to my troubles. I live in my father's house but am deprived of all joy; 
a wicked stepmother is driving me from the white world. Tell me how I should 
live and what I should do." The doll would eat, then would give her advice and 
comfort her in her trouble, and in the morning, she would perform all the 
chores for Vasilisa, who rested in the shade and picked flowers while the 
flower beds were weeded, the cabbage sprayed, the water brought in, and the 
stove fired. The doll even showed Vasilisa an herb that would protect her from 
sunburn. She led an easy life, thanks to her doll.

Several years went by. Vasilisa grew up and reached the marriage age. She was 
wooed by all the young men in the village, but no one would even look at the 
stepmother's daughters. The stepmother was more spiteful than ever, and her 
answer to all the suitors was: "I will not give the youngest in marriage 
before the elder ones." And each time she sent a suitor away, she vented her 
anger on Vasilisa in cruel blows.

One day the merchant had to leave home for a long time in order to trade in 
distant lands. The stepmother moved to another house; near that house was a 
thick forest, and in a glade of that forest there stood a hut, and in the hut 
lived Baba Yaga. She never allowed anyone to come near her and ate human 
beings as if they were chickens. Having moved into the new house, the 
merchant's wife, hating Vasilisa, repeatedly sent the girl to the woods for 
one thing or another; but each time Vasilisa returned home safe and sound: her 
doll had showed her the way and kept her far from Baba Yaga's hut.

Autumn came. The stepmother gave evening work to all three maidens: the oldest 
had to make lace, the second had to knit stockings, and Vasilisa had to spin; 
and each one had to finish her task. The stepmother put out the lights all 
over the house, leaving only one candle in the room where the girls worked, 
and went to bed. The girls worked. The candle began to smoke; one of the 
stepsisters took up a scissors to trim it, but instead, following her mother's 
order, she snuffed it out, as though inadvertently. "What shall we do now?" 
said the girls. "There is no light in the house and our tasks are not finished. 
Someone must run to Baba Yaga and get some light." "The pins on my lace give 
me light," said the one who was making lace. "I shall not go." "I shall not go 
either," said the one who was knitting stockings, "my knitting needles give me 
light." "Then you must go," both of them cried to their stepsister. "Go to 
Baba Yaga!" And they pushed Vasilisa out of the room. She went into her own 
little room, put the supper she had prepared before her doll, and said: "Now 
dolly, eat, and aid me in my need. They are sending me to Baba Yaga for a 
light, and she will eat me up." The doll ate the supper and its eyes burned 
like two candles. "Fear not, Vasilisushka," it said. "Go where you are sent, 
only keep me with you all the time. With me in your pocket you will suffer no 
harm from Baba Yaga." Vasilisa made ready, put her doll in her pocket, and, 
having made the sign of the cross, went into the deep forest.

She walked in fear and trembling. Suddenly a horseman galloped past her: his 
face was white, he was dressed in white, his horse was white, and his horse's 
trappings were white - daybreak came to the woods.

She walked on farther, and a second horseman galloped past her: he was all red, 
he was dressed in red, and his horse was red - the sun began to rise.

Vasilisa walked the whole night and the whole day, and only on the following 
evening did she come to the glade where Baba Yaga's hut stood. The fence 
around the hut was made of human bones, and on the spikes were human skulls 
with staring eyes; the doors had human legs for doorposts, human hands for 
bolts, and a mouth with sharp teeth in place of a lock. Vasilisa was numb with 
horror and stood rooted to the spot. Suddenly another horseman rode by. He was 
all black, he was dressed in black, and his horse was black. He galloped up to 
Baba Yaga's door and vanished, as though the earth had swallowed him up - 
night came, but the darkness did not last long. The eyes of all the skulls on 
the fence began to gleam and the glade was as bright as day. Vasilisa 
shuddered with fear, but not knowing where to run, remained on the spot.

Soon a terrible noise resounded through the woods, the trees crackled, the dry 
leaves rustled; from the woods Baba Yaga drove out in a mortar, prodding it on 
with a pestle, and sweeping her traces with a broom. She rode up to the gate, 
stopped, and sniffing the air around her, cried: "Fie, fie! I smell a Russian 
smell! Who is here?" Vasilisa came up to the old witch and, trembling with 
fear, bowed low to her and said: "It is I, grandmother. My stepsisters sent me 
to get some light." "Very well," said Baba Yaga. "I know them, but before I 
give you the light you must live with me and work for me; if not, I will eat 
you up." Then she turned to the gate and cried: "Hey, my strong bolts, unlock! 
Open up, my wide gate!" The gate opened, and Baba Yaga drove in whistling. 
Vasilisa followed her, and then everything closed again.

Having entered the room, Baba Yaga stretched herself out in her chair and said 
to Vasilisa: "Serve me what is in the stove; I am hungry." Vasilisa lit a 
torch from the skulls on the fence and began to serve Yaga the food from the 
stove - and enough food had been prepared for ten people. She brought kvass, 
mead, beer, and wine from the cellar. The old witch ate and drank everything, 
leaving for Vasilisa only a little cabbage soup, a crust of bread, and a piece 
of pork. Then Baba Yaga made ready to go to bed and said: "Tomorrow after I go, 
see to it that you sweep the yard, clean the hut, cook the dinner, wash the 
linen, and go to the cornbin and sort out a bushel of wheat. And let 
everything be done, or I will eat you up!" Having given these orders, Baba 
Yaga began to snore. Vasilisa set the remnants of the old witch's supper 
before her doll, wept bitter tears, and said: "Here dolly, eat, and aid me in 
my need! Baba Yaga has given me a hard task to do and threatens to eat me up 
if I do not do it all. Help me!" The doll answered: "Fear not, Vasilisa the 
Beautiful! Eat your supper, say your prayers, and go to sleep; the morning is 
wiser than the evening."

Very early next morning Vasilisa awoke, after Baba Yaga had arisen, and looked 
out of the window. The eyes of the skulls were going out; then the white 
horseman flashed by, and it was daybreak. Baba Yaga went out into the yard, 
whistled, and the mortar, pestle, and broom appeared before her. The red horse 
man flashed by, and the sun rose. Baba Yaga sat in the mortar, prodded it on 
with the pestle, and swept her traces with the broom. Vasilisa remained alone, 
looked about Baba Yaga's hut, was amazed at the abundance of everything, and 
stopped wondering which work she should do first. For lo and behold, all the 
work was done; the doll was picking the last shreds of chaff from the wheat. 
"Ah my savior," said Vasilisa to her doll, "you have delivered me from death." 
"All you have to do," answered the doll, creeping into Vasilisa's pocket, "is 
to cook the dinner; cook it with the help of God and then rest, for your 
health's sake."

When evening came Vasilisa set the table and waited for Baba Yaga. Dusk began 
to fall, the black horseman flashed by the gate, and night came; only the 
skulls' eyes were shining. The trees crackled, the leaves rustled; Baba Yaga 
was coming. Vasilisa met her. "Is everything done?" asked Yaga. "Please see 
for yourself, grandmother," said Vasilisa. Baba Yaga looked at everything, was 
annoyed that there was nothing she could complain about, and said: "Very well, 
then." Then she cried: "My faithful servants, my dear friends, grind my wheat!" 
Three pairs of hands appeared, took the wheat, and carried it out of sight. 
Baba Yaga ate her fill, made ready to go to sleep, and again gave her orders 
to Vasilisa. "Tomorrow," she commanded, "do the same work you have done today, 
and in addition take the poppy seed from the bin and get rid of the dust, 
grain by grain; someone threw dust into the bins out of spite." Having said 
this, the old witch turned to the wall and began to snore, and Vasilisa set 
about feeding her doll. The doll ate, and spoke as she had spoken the day 
before: "Pray to God and go to sleep; the morning is wiser than the evening. 
Everything will be done, Vasilisushka."

Next morning Baba Yaga again left the yard in her mortar, and Vasilisa and the 
doll soon had all the work done. The old witch came back, looked at everything, 
and cried: "My faithful servants, my dear friends, press the oil out of the 
poppy seed!" Three pairs of hands appeared, took the poppy seed, and carried 
it out of sight. Baba Yaga sat down to dine; she ate, and Vasilisa stood 
silent. "Why do you not speak to me?" said Baba Yaga. "You stand there as 
though you were dumb." "I did not dare to speak," said Vasilisa, "but if 
you'll give me leave, I'd like to ask you something." "Go ahead. But not every 
question has a good answer; if you know too much, you will soon grow old." "I 
want to ask you, grandmother, only about what I have seen. As I was on my way 
to you, a horseman on a white horse, all white himself and dressed in white, 
overtook me. Who is he?" "He is my bright day," said Baba Yaga. "Then another 
horseman overtook me; he had a red horse, was red himself, and was dressed in 
red. Who is he?" "He is my red sun." "And who is the black horseman whom I met 
at your very gate, grandmother?" "He is my dark night - and all of them are my 
faithful servants."

Vasilisa remembered the three pairs of hands, but kept silent. "Why don't you 
ask me more?" said Baba Yaga. "That will be enough," Vasilisa replied. "You 
said yourself, grandmother, that one who knows too much will grow old soon." 
"It is well," said Baba Yaga, "that you ask only about what you have seen 
outside my house, not inside my house; I do not like to have my dirty linen 
washed in public, and I eat the overcurious. Now I shall ask you something. 
How do you manage to do the work I set for you?" "I am helped by the blessing 
of my mother," said Vasilisa. "So that is what it is," shrieked Baba Yaga. 
"Get you gone, blessed daughter! I want no blessed ones in my house!" She 
dragged Vasilisa out of the room and pushed her outside the gate, took a skull 
with burning eyes from the fence, stuck it on a stick, and gave it to the girl, 
saying: "Here is your light for your step sisters. Take it; that is what they 
sent you for."

Vasilisa ran homeward by the light of the skull, which went out only at 
daybreak, and by nightfall of the following day she reached the house. As she 
approached the gate, she was about to throw the skull away, thinking that 
surely they no longer needed a light in the house. But suddenly a dull voice 
came from the skull, saying: "Do not throw me away, take me to your 
stepmother." She looked at the stepmother's house and, seeing that there was 
no light in the windows, decided to enter with her skull. For the first time 
she was received kindly. Her stepmother and stepsisters told her that since 
she had left they had had no fire in the house; they were unable to strike a 
flame themselves, and whatever light was brought by the neighbors went out the 
moment it was brought into the house. "Perhaps your fire will last," said the 
stepmother. The skull was brought into the room, and its eyes kept staring at 
the stepmother and her daughters, and burned them. They tried to hide, but 
wherever they went the eyes followed them. By morning they were all burned to 
ashes; only Vasilisa remained untouched by the fire.

In the morning Vasilisa buried the skull in the ground, locked up the house, 
and went to the town. A certain childless old woman gave her shelter, and 
there she lived, waiting for her father's return. One day she said to the 
woman: "I am weary of sitting without work, grandmother. Buy me some flax, the 
best you can get; at least I shall be spinning." The old woman bought good 
flax and Vasilisa set to work. She spun as fast as lightning and her threads 
were even and thin as a hair. She spun a great deal of yarn; it was time to 
start weaving it, but no comb fine enough for Vasilisa's yarn could be found, 
and no one would undertake to make one. Vasilisa asked her doll for aid. The 
doll said: "Bring me an old comb, an old shuttle, and a horse's mane; I will 
make a loom for you." Vasilisa got everything that was required and went to 
sleep, and during the night the doll made a wonderful loom for her.

By the end of the winter the linen was woven, and it was so fine that it could 
be passed through a needle like a thread. In the spring the linen was bleached, 
and Vasilisa said to the old woman: "Grandmother, sell this linen and keep the 
money for yourself." The old woman looked at the linen and gasped: "No, my 
child! No one can wear such linen except the tsar; I shall take it to the 
palace." The old woman went to the tsar's palace and walked back and forth 
beneath the windows. The tsar saw her and asked: "What do you want, old woman?" 
"Your Majesty," she answered, "I have brought rare merchandise; I do not want 
to show it to anyone but you." The tsar ordered her to be brought before him, 
and when he saw the linen he was amazed. "What do you want for it?" asked the 
tsar. "It has no price, little father tsar! I have brought it as a gift to 
you." The tsar thanked her and rewarded her with gifts. The tsar ordered 
shirts to be made of the linen. It was cut, but nowhere could they find a 
seamstress who was willing to sew them. For a long time they tried to find one, 
but in the end the tsar summoned the old woman and said: "You have known how 
to spin and weave such linen, you must know how to sew shirts of it." "It was 
not I that spun and wove this linen, Your Majesty," said the old woman. "This 
is the work of a maiden to whom I give shelter." "Then let her sew the shirts," 
ordered the tsar.

The old woman returned home and told everything to Vasilisa. "I knew all the 
time," said Vasilisa to her, "that I would have to do this work." She locked 
herself in her room and set to work; she sewed without rest and soon a dozen 
shirts were ready. The old woman took them to the tsar, and Vasilisa washed 
herself, combed her hair, dressed in her finest clothes, and sat at the window. 
She sat there waiting to see what would happen. She saw a servant of the tsar 
entering the courtyard. The messenger came into the room and said: "The tsar 
wishes to see the needlewoman who made his shirts, and wishes to reward her 
with his own hands." Vasilisa appeared before the tsar. When the tsar saw 
Vasilisa the Beautiful he fell madly in love with her. "No, my beauty" he said, 
"I will not separate from you; you shall be my wife." He took Vasilisa by her 
white hands, seated her by his side, and the wedding was celebrated at once. 
Soon Vasilisa's father returned, was overjoyed at her good fortune, and came 
to live in his daughter's house. Vasilisa took the old woman into her home too, 
and carried her doll in her pocket till the end of her life.
